**Project Overview**
This project focuses on predicting whether a candidate will secure a job placement based on key academic and professional factors such as CGPA, IQ level, work experience, and internship experience. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to build an intelligent system that can analyze historical placement data and make data-driven predictions.

**Objective**
To develop a predictive model that can determine a student's placement status.
To identify the most influential factors affecting placements.
To help students understand their job prospects and take necessary steps for improvement.
To assist recruiters in making data-driven hiring decisions.
**Dataset & Features**
The dataset consists of multiple student records with the following key features:
**CGPA:** Academic performance indicator.
**IQ Level:** Cognitive ability assessment.
**Experience:** Prior work experience in years.
**Internship:** Whether the candidate has undergone internships (Yes/No).
**Placement Status**: Target variable (Placed/Not Placed).
****Methodology**
1.Data Preparation:**
Clean the dataset and handle any missing values.
**Normalize numerical data like CGPA and IQ for better accuracy.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Analyze trends using graphs to understand which factors impact placements the most.
3.**Feature Selection & Model Training:**
Select the most important features: CGPA, IQ, experience, and internships.
Train different models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
**4.Model Evaluation:**
Check the accuracy of the model using accuracy_score and other metrics.
Compare models to find the best one.
**5.Prediction & Deployment:**
Use the best model to predict placement outcomes.
Optionally, create a simple application where students can check their placement chances.
**Expected Outcome**
A machine learning model that predicts whether a student will get placed.
Insights into how CGPA, IQ, experience, and internships affect placements.
A useful tool for students to assess their job prospects and for recruiters to identify strong candidates.
