# toy_project
This project predicts whether a student will get placed based on key factors like CGPA, IQ, experience, and internships. Using historical placement data, a machine learning model is trained to classify students as "Placed" or "Not Placed." The model analyzes these factors and provides insights into how they impact placements, helping students improve their employability.
